<dfn>
We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the crypto began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; 
maybe you should jump onto rumkin...." And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the hallway was full of what looked like hairy man apes, 
all running and screeching and diving around us trying to get to the next talk, which was about a hundred yards down the hallway of the Rio. And a voice was 
screaming "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?"
</dfn>
<br><br>
<dfn>
Then it was quiet again. My teammate was wearing grover pants and had taken his superman shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process.
"What the hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and covered with what looked like cheap knock off welding goggles.
"Never mind," I said. "It's your turn to crack." I hit the laptop and aimed the Great Red Fox toward the rumkin. No point mentioning the scytales, I thought. 
The poor bastard will see them soon enough.
</dfn>
<br><br>

<h1>The Badge Challenge (bC) </h1>
<dfn>
<h3>First things second. Thank you LosT, Thank you Ellen, and Thank you unknown doers! Thank you those we manipulated. For we who are about to go mad, we salute you!</h3>
</dfn>
<br><br>
<p>The process of solving the bC is not a clear line. More like a blind drunken stumble through a cactus field. We didn’t know where we were going and it hurt. 
I equate it to having your brain stepped on repeatedly with spiked shows then for some reason asking LosT to do it again but harder this time. 
</p>
<p>As we entered past the menacing Goons with their red scarab badges, we saw a giant circle in the center of the registration area.
 Gears, eyes, and various intriguing numbers ran around the circle's edge. Other graphical elements caught our eye. 
Signs designating specific areas like the various Tracks, Capture the Flag contest area, the Wireless Village, Hardware Hacking Village, and outside of the Penn & Teller room had cryptographic strings (messages) on them, 
which when combined with the Badges and Lanyards we would receive at the registration, were the basis for the badge Challenge.
</p>

<p>On Wednesday night, we were able to get a picture of a lanyard from goon and later that night we were actually gifted with a lanyard.
 The Lanyard has what looks like a Baudot code, this is NOT the case at all. We copied down the cipher and stared at if for hours. </p>

<h5>
<p>
*(one thing to note for us is we were also competing in the Mystery Challenge so a lot of this was done in between getting mentally abused by lost, 
yes there are actual scars on and in our gray matter that will never heal. 
This is part of lost’s overall agenda, more on that later)
</p>
</h5>
<p>Drink. </p>
<p>Sleep. </p>
<p>Wake up.</p>
<p>Go down to registration and wait for 2 hours.</p>


<p>At some point Wednesday night we discovered that there 3 different lanyards and made sure we got all 3 when we purchased our badges.
 After our badges were in hand,  we immediately noticed some similarities, and difference between the different models. Each badge has a binary representation of 4 bits on it,
  each badge had what appeared to be a word made from Roman Numerals, and each badge has a unique number. We stood at the exit of registration and, looking official, 
convinced the passers by to let us look at their badges to obtain the different numbers / roman numerals / binary combinations. 
</p>


<p>During our badge recon, we copied down the cipher on the floor of registration and then went to go sift through the defcon program to find what else we would find.
 The only obvious item in the program for bC was on page 4 ( program cipher). 
</p> 

<p>We sat down amidst a pile of resistors, boards and soldering irons. 
CK looked intently at the lanyard. snowchyld looked intently at the green piece of fabric between his fingers.<em>”d!”</em> he exclaimed. <em>‘The hell?’</em> came a response from 
the One True Greg. <em>“It’s a ‘d’ then a ‘9’ then an ‘s’ Write this down!”</em> came the hasty reply. CK started writing as the three characters spat from the dried lips 
of his teammate. <em>“d,9,s,9”</em>. CK repeated. “<em>ss9d..</em>”. The conversation went on for a handful of minutes. When snowchyld was done, he explained the pictographic reference.
 CK grabbed the yellow lanyard and repeated the process to snow.The <em>‘DS9’</em> code quickly filled up 3 text files, and was emailed to the group.
  <em>“I hope no one thinks this is Deep Space Nine”</em> thought Elegin, his true inner Trekkie betraying his thoughts.
</p>
<p>Thursday was a bit of wash for bC because of mC required meeting and ciphers. At some point on Thursday we figured out the registration floor cipher and the lanyard cipher 
which both  yielded riddles. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Badge:</h3>
<p>Elegin,Dec,and CK got all the badges synced except the black badge. Lost had the only black badge that we could see and was letting people sync with it (thrusday/friday).
 We got CK's badge to sync, Elegin and Dec’s badge wouldn’t for some reason. We hook CK’s badge up  to the parallax terminal and got some clues.</p> 
<p>During this time, snow went to HHV and got the clues from a solved (seen all the badges) badge.</p>
<p>This told us we needed to use the 3 lanyards together... but we had already solved that part.</p>

<h3>Lanyard Cipher:</h3>
<h5>*(These events take place over Wednesday night, Thursday, and Friday)</h5>

<p>Elegin managed to snag a Lanyard on Wednesday and sat down with CK and GGreg to look at it. 
 CK immediately recognized the pattern as Baudot code (nightmares from prequal rabbit holes)
 but after a few hours without any successful decoding, decided that the symbols must be something else.
 </p>
<p>Once we discovered that there were exactly 3 different lanyards with exactly 3 unique symbols, the idea popped:<em> CK “3^3 = 27!, 0-26!... 26 
letters in the alphabet!”</em>  We were at the bar when the thought occured to him so we didnt actually try this idea for a few hours.  But when we 
did make it up to the room, we typed up the lanyards, wrote a few lines of python, and <strong>BINGO</strong>.
CK bruteforced from the three lanyards (believed to be the first lanyard decoding), was _not_ Baudot (LosT said this in badge intro / 101) , 
which leads to a riddle that we spent the first night staring at.</p> 
<h4><em>the ox door closer chases the green witch five min behind her he used to be mary</em></h4>

<p>Somehow we had gotten Greenwich from Green witch, so this made sense for oxford time</p>
<p>Snow tells us ox door = oxford (‘five min behind’ == oxford time)</p>
<p>CK uses Google Fu to find Great Tom wiki page; Leads to /GreatTom </p>
<p>Several hours after submitting, LosT announced that the first lanyard decoding had been received! </p>

<h3>Throat Cipher:</h3>
<p>Thursday we had time to take a good look around the con and notice the 2 other floor graphics; Face graphic (Throat Cipher) and Circuit schematic. </p>
<p>The Circuit schematic was for the mC ( which we spend way too long on) and we didn’t even look at the Throat Cipher until Saturday</p>

<p> We did however decipher the text on the left of the throat thursday which spelled PANGRAM and we 
correctly guess <em>“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”</em> but at the time we did not know what to 
do with it. Later this conversation occurred:</p>
<p>Mar picture + throat cipher (PANGRAM -> didn’t put it in, LosT gave <snow> a clue)</p>
<p><em>[Throat cipher conversation]</em></p>
<p>LosT:<em> did you do the throat cipher?</em></p>
<p>snowchyld:<em> not yet</em></p>
<p>LosT:<em> did you work out what it said</em></p>
<p>snowchyld:<em> pangram</em></p>
<p>LosT: <em>which is?</em></p>
<p>snowchyld: <em>the quick brown fo..</em></p>
<p>LosT: <em>did you try that?</em></p>
<p>snowchyld:<em> t(“t) <- me flipping him off and running to you guys</em></p>
<p>CK: stares at dots for an hour while decoding.</p>
<p>This directed us to /SpringHeeledJack</p>

<h3>Program Cipher</h3>
<p>While working on mC and bC, Elegin and CK chill near LosT waiting for hints from either LosT or other teams talking too loudly.</p>
<p>LosT decides to break into song, singing “Wish You Were Here” by Pink Floyd<sub>*as a side LosT did a good job had but should keep his day and night job</sub></p>
<p>CK nearly voids himself in realization. (the “poetic gibberish” and this song share A LOT of phrases)</p>
<p>CK swaps out phrases from the song to obtain the OTP key for the program cipher.
This led to /nyctographicnotes (yes … all lower case).</p>
<p>From here, we sent an email and received back our final keyword: BlackSolitas</p>

<h3>Final Test</h3>

<p>Base 42 was obtained by the clue ‘Adams radix’ (HHGTTG - Douglas Adams)
And hitchers number … and it was pretty obvious</p>
<p>Dec did some quick maths to figure out base multiplication problem: 4 * 13 = 1a (base 42)</p>
<p>Snow pointed at the correct roman numeral MIX (CK fail: apparently VM is no valid)
Roman numbers follow a certain pattern, MIX (1009) was the only one that followed the rules</p>
<p>A few submissions later (to figure out the actual required format) and we win!</p>

<h3>[Post contest discovery]</h3>
<p>When we were solving the final part of the badge, we were in direct communication with LosT 
(we were the first team to reach the final puzzle and there was less than an hour before the
contest area would be shut down).  Since we were e-mailing solutions to the final puzzle directly
to him, we missed this last gem.  The actual grand finale to the badge contest resides at: <a href="http://defcon.org/1057/10091a" target="_blank" name="http://defcon.org/1057/10091a">http://defcon.org/1057/10091a</a>

<hr>
<p>This story is done and a lot is left out, some on purpose some and accident ( hopefully we will fill it in as we realize it).
There was a lot of FAIL in here that isn't covered and there is a ton. If you're not failing you're not learning, and let me tell you we learned.
</p>

<font  color="gray">
<p>begin elegin's crazy banter</p>
<p >Now, on to the discovery! World Domination! Yes! During out brutal descent into the madness, 
we found our minds being destroyed slowing via impossible crypts and hints.
 The human mind is not designed to withstand such attacks. This led to our discovery!</p>
<p >The first is a link between the electronic badges and the mC. Stage 1, mC is designed to weaken the minds defenses against external influence. This was accomplished by the mC.
 With all the mC contestants in a weakened state, LosT launch his second stage ( with the help for Joe Grand ) electronic badges!</p>

<p >This was a well crafted plan spanning 7 years. While Joe Grand introduced electronic badges everyone was like “this is so cool look what it does..look what I can do”, 
it was all a ploy. After years of weakening the minds of the mC challengers, it was time to strike! Defcon 18. Yes. The last Joe Grand badge. The flaw was over confidence. T
he badge source. Look at it. 
There is deep rooted program that triggers an IR sensor with a very strange code...MIND CONTROL! The weakened minds had no chance.</p>

<p >But LosT is crafty! He waited for Defcon 19. No electronic badges. Why is this? It was test to see if his devious plan had worked. He was looking for lieutenants for his army. 
The Defcon 19 badge contest was designed to trigger the program embedded in the infected minds. It worked. The Brotherhood of Horus was created!</p>

<p >LosT has his army. He has his lieutenants. He now needs solders! Defcon 20! These Badges are designed to affect other badges like a virus. Ploy! They effect the mind. Did you sync your badge? Do you remember everything you did at Defcon? The stage is set.
 The lieutenants are in waiting! The soldiers are sleeping! The Brotherhood of Horus is coming! Are you prepared for battle.</p>
 
 <p > I am just glad Defcon 21 is canceled. </p>
