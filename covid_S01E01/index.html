<p>And the cursing and red herrings start.</p>
<p>This image is of the David Bowie album Hunky Dory and also the single “changes” of the same album. </p>
<p>In the html source we see a HINT.</p>

  <code>
    *HINT IF YOU'RE NEW HERE** <br>

  <p>
    The person on the briefcase is Blaise Pascal. 
    To be clear,I didn’t know it was Pascal until I did this write up. 
    I just guessed it was Blaise de Vigenère because that briefcase needed a code to unlock it and we have 
    <code>Npbegvqtlvbrylkvn</code>   to decipher and vignere would be a place to start.  
  </p>
  <p>{spoiler: it's a Vig}</p>
  <p>
    That being said, 
    look up Pascal  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal" target="_BLANK">Blaise Pascal</a> 
    which I think Lost wanted us to, specifically
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_calculator" target="_BLANK" >Pascal calculator</a>
  </p>

  <code>
  {update from 1o57 4/9/2020: "did you ever look up "Pascal Case" ? ;)" 
</code>
<br><br>
  <p>
  HAHAHAH, yeah that makes a lot more 
    sense and fits WAY better as context.}</p>
   <hr>
  <p>But a key is needed and it's “changes” the song from the hunky dory album... 
    which also had the same image on the single</p>
  <code>
    key: changes

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>But you might be asking WTF is up with the 60062 URL?</p>
  <p>
    We will get to that a little later, for now the answer to this page is a hint to it. Oh screw it, 
    it is the zipcode of the school in The Breakfast Club and other John Hughes movies. {The header image}

</p>
<p>The first computer to play music..CSIR Mark 1 (later named CSIRAC, the CSIR Automatic Computer)</p>
<p>But we still have the cipher text, The hints are maybe, possibly 
  , could be, conceivably , perchance , within realm of possibility , 
  hell only 1o57 knows for sure, in the TITLE tag and possibly the fiddler on the roof comment. 
</p>
  <pre>
    &lt;title&gt;  The simple things in life... &lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;!-- Without our traditions, our lives would be as  shaky as a fiddler on the roof.  --&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>Whatever the hints are or are not the cipher text is encoded with good old ROT13.</p>

<p>
  The deciphered text doesn’t work as the answer.. 
  &lt; cursing and red herrings &gt; ......  
  After way too long looking at the everything “the bridge on the river kwai”, 
  we ended up back on the photo and CSIRAC which played ‘Colonel Bogey March’ 
  which was in “the bridge on the river kwai”. So, long pause, the answer is <b> CSIRAC</b>!!

<p>Uh yeah, wtf, definitely some weird  &#128169; going on here. Not going to lie, 
  this took some time.  To sum up the photo you have bender that awkward text and the dog and two bowls. 
  {<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQEM19PgNw2/">Orginal post</a>}
  Apparently, dug was cut from the episode, poor little guy.  
</p>
<p>Cuteness aside, dug didn’t help with the plot or pacing of this episode so I see why Lost cut him. </p>
<p>Taking a step back to reading the name of the image file “Only Straight Re morse” ,
  &lt;title&gt;With A Dash of Calibri to Taste &lt;/title&gt;
 Data, and overall look of the image, I had nothing but something maybe to do with morse code.
 </p> 
  
 <p>After some soul searching and internal reflection of my life decisions, cyptok pulled a rabbit out of his hat and figured it out.</p>

<p> So here goes my best effort of explaining the 1o75ian remorse calibri cipher :</p>
 <p>
 For each Letter that has only straight lines it becomes a dash and letters with curves in 
 them becomes a dot, ignoring punctuation ...
</p>
<pre>
 DEAR
 .--. = P
 OL’
 .- = A
 DOG
 ...= S
</pre>

<p>
  In the end you will get PASSPHRASEMITH
</p>
<p>
  YAHHH!!!!! we are done..everyone goes home thanks for all the fish. 
  Well that didn’t work.. I know. I felt the same way. 
  Cursing and red herrings ensued for quite awhile. 
  To make a long story a little longer, I will let Lost explain:
</p>
<code><i>
"For those stuck in a mith,
I would single out the letter that your eye sees,
A different letter can sometimes change an entire word-"
</i></code>
<br>
<p>
Turns out the I is an A, to be fair they are only a dash apart, so it looks like Lost did a sprinkle and not a dash in the 1o75ian remorse calibri cipher recipe. 
</p>
<p>
So   - - - - <b> MATH </b> is the answer!

  Not going to go into the paths that we went down for this cause it ended up being a gimme, 
  goofed it for a minute or 1000. 
  The quote is from Allison in The Breakfast Club, 
  remember from the original URL /60062 
</p>
<p>The only real tricky piece was using her last name <b> AllisonReynolds</b></p>

This is all about Brian from The Breakfast Club. Not a lot of hints in the page just
</p>
<code>
  &lt;title&gt;Find a way.&lt;/title&gt;
</code>
<br>
<code>
  &lt;img src="BriansDish.jpg">
</code>
<br>
<br>
<p>
A lot of really weird paths were taken here and I am not comfortable telling you all where I ended up.. 
It wasn’t pretty. Some things can’t be unseen. 
After reading ALL of Brian's parts in the script multiple times and trying not very nice things, 
I was gifted with some hints from Lost. But before that just in case anyone wants to buy the
 dish Brian is holding  ---
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Studio-Flower-Pasta-Plate-Porcelain/dp/B009V1CFMK">BriansDish</a> 
</p>
<p>
  The hint I got was basically reading the script would not help. HOLY CRAP that was an understatement.
  The Dish is actually the front plate on Brian's mom's car in the beginning of the movie

<p>
With all the Breakfast Club research that we were doing this is pretty much immediate, or so we thought. 
To explain; Here is the scene of that picture in the movie. 
</p>
<br>
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="10573515" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.8823529411764706"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/make-it-snow-dandruff-ally-sheedy-breakfast-club-gif-10573515">Make It Snow GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/makeitsnow-gifs">Makeitsnow GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Trivia fact: parmesan cheese was used for her dandruff.
</p>
<p>
  We have “cuisine”,  the cheesy quote,  and the dandruff scene. Pretty clear ParmesanCheese .
</p>
<p>
So ParmesanCheese didn’t work.. Yeah I know, we couldn’t figure out what was going on..
 I can’t tell you how many times I watched the lunch scene, because I didn’t count,but it was a lot.
</p>
<p>
  1o57 swoops in to save the day on this one with the following message:
</p>
<code>
  “If you're stuck in the wheel of cheese, consider common, INCORRECT spellings ;) ... because reasons....”
</code>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>ParmeseanCheese</b>    lol...that was actually pretty funny</p>

<br><br>
<p>
This one is a bit on the outer edge. Let's take the quote from The Breakfast Club Bender to Brian: “SO, AHAB ... KYBO MEIN DOOBAGE”
</p>
<p>
Ahab obviously refers to moby dick and low and behold Kybo is a Boy Scout term for an outhouse. 
Arrow of Light is a cub scout award. So going through some trial and error we get <b> Kybo</b> as the final solution!

  There ya go. If you made it till the end, good for you. 
  I am willing to bet self quarantining might have something to with reading the credits here. 
  But since you are here.
</p>
<p>
  As always, cryptok and I would like to thank 1o57 for putting this together and taking our minds off 
  current events for a bit and we kinda are looking forward to another episode of 1o57 in Quarantine, 
  only because we will still be in Quarantine. I am hoping for a reboot, prequel, or sequel.  
  But, if we are still in Quarantine then I will definitely be 
  looking forward to being 1o57 in Quarantine again soon.
